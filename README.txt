I used c++ for this programming assignment
In order to compile this you must have CMake, as well as g++/gcc
cd into the correct directory "ProgAssignment2"
then, once inside the directory type "mkdir build" into the command line
after this type cd into build
then type "cmake .."
then type "make"
then type "./ProgAssignment2"
this final command will run the program

Thank you.
